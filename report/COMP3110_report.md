**Course:** COMP-3110

## 🧩 1. Introduction
This project designs a **line mapping tool** that identifies how each line in an **old version** of a source file maps to lines in a **new version**.  
Instead of developing a full implementation, the focus is on the **design, dataset, evaluation plan, and visualization**.  

The goal is to help developers analyze code changes more effectively by understanding:
- Which lines stayed the same  
- Which were modified, added, deleted, split, or merged  

The project also explores **how to visualize** these mappings in clear, user-friendly graphical interfaces.

## ⚙️ 2. Algorithm Design
The line mapping algorithm compares the content of two versions of a file — “old” and “new” — and identifies how their lines correspond.  

The process includes:
1. **Preprocessing** (normalize spaces and cases)  
2. **Exact matching** (detect unchanged lines)  
3. **Similarity scoring** (Levenshtein distance and token similarity)  
4. **Split and merge detection**  
5. **Confidence scoring** (0–1 based on match accuracy)  
6. **Mapping output** (table showing type and confidence)

### Example:
| Old Line | New Line(s) | Type | Confidence |
|-----------|--------------|------|-------------|
| 12 | 14 | unchanged | 1.0 |
| 15 | 18,19 | split | 0.9 |
| 21 | - | deleted | - |

The algorithm prioritizes **accuracy and interpretability**, providing both developers and researchers with clear insight into how code evolves between versions.

## 🧾 3. Dataset Design
The dataset contains **25 file pairs** (`pair_001_old.java` → `pair_025_new.java`) stored in:

```
dataset/
├─ pair_001_old.java
├─ pair_001_new.java
...
├─ pair_025_old.java
├─ pair_025_new.java
└─ ground_truth.csv
```

Each pair contains small, realistic Java modifications:
- Variable renames  
- Added or deleted lines  
- Modified text  
- Added comments  
- Split or merged statements  

The `ground_truth.csv` file provides the **true line mappings** used to evaluate the tool’s performance.

Example entry:
```csv
pair_id,old_line,new_line,mapping_type
pair_001,4,4,modified
pair_003,4,3,deleted
pair_004,3,4,added_line
```

This dataset supports both qualitative inspection (looking at pairs) and quantitative evaluation (using precision and recall).

## 📊 4. Evaluation Plan

The tool’s performance will be measured using **mapping accuracy** metrics such as:

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Precision** | % of predicted mappings that are correct |
| **Recall** | % of true mappings that were found |
| **F1-score** | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| **Mapping Coverage** | % of old lines that were mapped somewhere |

Formula Examples:
```csv
Precision = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalsePositives)
Recall = TruePositives / (TruePositives + FalseNegatives)
```

The evaluation will be done by comparing the tool’s output against the ground_truth.csv file.

To ensure fairness, the dataset includes diverse file types and modification styles.

## 🖥️ 5. Visualization Design

Three graphical interfaces are proposed for displaying line-mapping results.

### 🧩 1. Side-by-Side Line Mapping View

- Displays old file (left) and new file (right)
- Uses colored curved lines to connect related lines
- Ideal for developers reviewing code manually

### 🌊 2. Sankey Flow Diagram

- Shows how lines “flow” from old to new files
- Wide colored bands represent splits, merges, and deletions
- Best for high-level visualization of large files

### 🔥 3. Heatmap Confidence View

- Displays mapping strength as a grid
- Darker cells indicate higher confidence
- Useful for quickly spotting uncertain mappings

---
## 🧠 6. Bonus: Bug-Introducing Change Detection

A proposed extension uses line mapping to detect bug-introducing commits:
- After identifying mappings between old and new lines,
- The tool can trace whether deleted or modified lines were previously linked to bug fixes.
- If so, it flags the corresponding change as a potential bug-introducing change (BIC).

This feature builds on research in software evolution analysis and could be implemented later for extra marks or research credit.

---
## ✅ 7. Conclusion

This project outlines the full design of a line mapping visualization tool without implementation.
It includes:

- A detailed algorithm
- A 25-file dataset
- A structured evaluation plan
- Clear visualization mockups
- A proposed extension for advanced change detection

The repository demonstrates both technical understanding and design clarity, fulfilling all project requirements.
